While training, for the Random Forest Regressor, I would use Grid Search to find the best parameters/hyperparameters, train my model on the training data set, and pick the best parameter. Then I would compare the performance between the Logistic Regression and Neural Network model using evaluation metrics such as R2 and mean squared error, then take the best model. For the Neural Network model, because there are different ranges of data between the columns (shown below), I need to add a normalization layer to the neural network before the training and prediction process."

    "**Conclusion:** From the 2 evaluation scores, we can see that the 2 models are similar and comparable in terms of the Mean Squared Error score and the R2 score. Therefore, we can conclude that the Random Forest Regressor is preferable over the Neural Network because it has a faster time to train and predict. The Neural Network model has also been tested with different epoch numbers, at 10, the scores are 0.46 and 0.54 for MSE and R2, and at 1, the scores are 10.3 and -229.53."
